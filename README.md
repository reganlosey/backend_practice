# [‚òï  Brewed To Serve üçµ](https://brewedtoserve.herokuapp.com/)

...get it?
<sup style="font-size:5px">because it's a API and serves info about brewed drinks? I thought it was funny</sup>

<br>
<br>

### Overview:
Brewed to Serve is an API built with Node and Express.js to host a variety of coffee and tea data.
This was a super fun side project and a great opportunity for me to practice my abilities writing backend Javascript.
I'd had some experience creating an API for a group project when I was in school but I enjoyed the challenge of writing one myself and having a lot of creative freedom.
