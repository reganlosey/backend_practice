<sup style="font-size:5px">because it's a API and serves info about brewed drinks? I thought it was funny</sup>

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Overview:</h2>

[Brewed to Serve](https://brewedtoserve.herokuapp.com/) is an API built with Node and Express.js to host a variety of coffee and tea data.
This was a super fun side project and a great opportunity for me to practice my abilities writing backend Javascript.
I'd had some experience creating an API for a group project when I was in school but I enjoyed the challenge of writing one myself and having a lot of creative freedom.

### Future Iterations:
1. Implement database.
2. Expand information included in each object. (Ex: ingredients and description of each beverage, images, etc.)
